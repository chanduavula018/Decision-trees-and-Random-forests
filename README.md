Sure! Here's the updated **README** with the **project structure section removed** as requested:

## 📘 README – Decision Trees & Random Forests Project

### 🧠 **Objective**

This project demonstrates the application of **tree-based machine learning models** — specifically **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests** — on the **Heart Disease Dataset**. The primary goal is to perform **classification**, analyze model behavior, prevent overfitting, and interpret model results using feature importance.

---

### 🛠️ **Tools & Libraries Used**

* **Python 3**
* **Pandas** – for data manipulation
* **Scikit-learn** – for machine learning models
* **Graphviz** – for tree visualization
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for plotting feature importances
* **Jupyter Notebook** (optional) – for interactive analysis

---

### 📊 **Dataset**

* **Name**: Heart Disease Dataset
* **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle
* **Target Variable**: `target` (1 = presence of heart disease, 0 = absence)
* The dataset contains patient health attributes such as age, cholesterol, resting blood pressure, etc.

---

### 🔄 **Workflow Summary**

#### 1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**

* Loaded the dataset and split it into training and test sets.
* Ensured the dataset was clean and ready for modeling.

#### 2. **Decision Tree Classifier**

* Trained a decision tree to classify patients based on health attributes.
* Visualized the decision tree to understand how decisions are made.
* Evaluated accuracy on the test set.

#### 3. **Overfitting Control**

* Investigated overfitting by adjusting the maximum tree depth.
* Compared training and testing accuracy at different depth levels to find optimal complexity.

#### 4. **Random Forest Classifier**

* Trained a random forest ensemble to improve performance.
* Compared its accuracy to the decision tree and found improved generalization.

#### 5. **Feature Importance**

* Identified the most important features in the dataset contributing to predictions.
* Visualized these using bar plots for easier interpretation.

#### 6. **Cross-Validation**

* Used 5-fold cross-validation to assess the stability and robustness of both models.

### 📈 **Results**

| Model         | Test Accuracy | CV Accuracy (5-fold) |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| Decision Tree | \~0.75–0.80   | \~0.76               |
| Random Forest | \~0.83–0.88   | \~0.85               |

* **Random Forest** consistently performed better than a single Decision Tree.
* Important predictive features include `cp` (chest pain type), `thalach` (maximum heart rate), `oldpeak` (ST depression), and `ca` (number of major vessels colored).

---

### 🔍 **Conclusion**

* **Decision Trees** are simple and interpretable but prone to overfitting.
* **Random Forests** offer better performance and generalization by aggregating multiple trees.
* Feature importance analysis provides valuable insights into which factors influence heart disease predictions.
* Cross-validation confirms that Random Forests are more stable on unseen data.

### 📝 **To Do / Future Work**

* Tune hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV** or **RandomizedSearchCV**.
* Add **precision, recall, F1-score**, and **ROC-AUC** metrics for deeper evaluation.
* Experiment with advanced models like **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, or **CatBoost**.
